## 📍 Roadmap Issue

The **pinned Roadmap Issue** serves as the central development plan.  
It outlines:
- ✅ Completed milestones  
- 🚧 Current work in progress  
- 🎯 Planned features  
- 💡 Nice-to-have ideas  

➡️ [View the Roadmap Issue](../../issues/1)

## 🗂 GitHub Projects Board

For task management and workflow, we maintain a **Projects Board** with four columns:
1. **Backlog** → Ideas and features not yet started  
2. **In Progress** → Features currently being developed  
3. **Review / Testing** → Pull requests and tasks awaiting review or testing  
4. **Done** → Completed features and merged code  

➡️ [View the Project Board](../../projects)

## 🔄 How They Work Together

- The **Roadmap Issue** provides the *big picture* vision.  
- The **Projects Board** tracks *day-to-day progress*.  
- Issues and pull requests are linked to the board for visibility.

## 👩‍💻 Contributor Workflow

3. **Pick an Issue** or suggest a new one.
