# Project Statement

While it would be possible to release a minimal version of the application quickly, the long-term value of this project depends on thorough research and careful development. The time invested in building a scientifically grounded and well-documented system is what will ultimately determine the applicationâ€™s usefulness and credibility.

## Core Research Priorities
- **Frequency Cataloging**
  - Gather and document all categories of frequencies relevant to PEMF and audio generation.  
  - Trace the origins of these frequencies with multiple layers of confirmation and evidence of continued use.  
  - Build detailed metadata and supporting documentation for each frequency.  

- **Testing Framework**
  1. **Software Validation**:  
     Research audio analysis tools and develop methods to confirm that generated audio matches expected parameters. Compare against existing reference materials where possible.  
  2. **Hardware Validation**:  
     Investigate Linux-compatible tools and hardware for measuring PEMF and frequency output in real-world conditions.  

- **Benchmarking Use Cases**  
  Research what other PEMF and frequency audio solutions are doing, across four domains:  
  1. Theoretical literature (proposed applications).  
  2. Practical literature (advised or reported applications).  
  3. Industry practices (non-consumer, professional/clinical).  
  4. Consumer software and DIY communities.  

## Development Goals
- Incorporate techniques proven to be effective and advantageous across research and industry.  
- Use these techniques as the basis for building a robust testing methodology.  
- Ensure the final application is not only functional but also scientifically defensible and practically useful.
