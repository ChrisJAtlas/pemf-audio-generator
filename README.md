The **PEMF Audio Generator** is an open-source toolkit for generating **PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) audio files** in WAV/FLAC format.

These audio files can be played through an amplifier and coil (such as a Rodin coil) to produce pulsed electromagnetic fields at specific frequencies.

This project emphasizes **research-backed frequency sets, rigorous validation, and clear documentation**, ensuring the audio produced is accurate and credible for research use.

## 📖 Project Overview

### A Brief Note on PEMF
Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) technology has been studied for decades in contexts like bone healing, pain management, and neurological research.  

In recent years, **PEMF coils** — including the Rodin coil design — have become more accessible to the public. This opens new opportunities for exploration but also raises important safety considerations.  

This project provides open-source scripts to generate **PEMF-ready audio files** for **research and educational purposes only**.

---

### Categories of Frequencies
Over time, numerous categories of EMF frequencies have been proposed or studied:

- **Brainwave bands** (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)  
- **Schumann resonances**  
- **Therapeutic ranges** studied for bone healing, pain relief, and recovery  
- **Alternative systems** like Solfeggio tones, Chakras, and Planetary “Cosmic Octave” mappings  

👉 See [CATEGORIES.md](CATEGORIES.md) for a detailed breakdown of each, including origins and reliability levels.

⚠️ Not all coils or playback systems can reproduce every frequency.  
Amplitude-modulated audio may be required — the provided scripts support this.

---

## 🛠 Project Goals
- Provide **transparent, reproducible scripts** for generating PEMF audio tracks.  
- Support **metadata-tagged files** for easy playback organization.  
- Encourage **research-based use**, not commercial or medical claims.  
- Keep contributions open, auditable, and provenance-driven.  

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

This project follows a **documentation-first, code-second** approach.  
The current focus is implementing a baseline **Theta frequency generator**, with expansion into other categories via CSV libraries.

- 📍 See the pinned [Roadmap Issue](../../issues/1) for milestones.  
- 🗂 Track progress in [Projects](../../projects).  
- 📖 Read more about how roadmap + project board work together: [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md)

## Disclaimer

This repository is provided **for research, experimentation, and educational purposes only**.

- The authors and contributors **assume no liability** for use or misuse of these scripts or audio files.  
- While some frequencies are supported by peer-reviewed research, this does **not imply that every frequency is safe or beneficial**.  
- Anyone experimenting with PEMF audio output does so **entirely at their own risk**.  

Although playback via consumer audio chains is technically possible, **dedicated frequency generators and certified PEMF devices are safer**, as they typically include hazard controls and regulatory oversight.
