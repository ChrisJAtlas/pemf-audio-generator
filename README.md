Open-source Python scripts for generating **PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) audio files** in WAV/FLAC format.  
These audio files can be played through an amplifier and coil (such as a Rodin coil) to produce pulsed electromagnetic fields at specific frequencies.

## üìñ Project Overview

### A Brief Note on PEMF
Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) technology has been studied for decades in contexts like bone healing, pain management, and neurological research.  

In recent years, **PEMF coils** ‚Äî including the well-known Rodin coil design ‚Äî have become more accessible to the public. While this opens opportunities for exploration, it also raises safety considerations.  

This project provides open-source scripts to generate **PEMF-ready audio files** for **research and educational purposes only**.  
While you *can* play these through consumer audio chains and coils, **dedicated frequency generators and certified PEMF devices remain objectively safer**, as they typically include hazard controls and regulatory oversight.

---

### Categories of Frequencies
Over time, numerous categories of EMF frequencies have been proposed or studied. These include:

- **Brainwave bands** (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)  
- **Schumann resonances**  
- **Therapeutic ranges** studied for bone healing, pain relief, and recovery  
- **Alternative systems** like Solfeggio tones, Chakras, and Planetary ‚ÄúCosmic Octave‚Äù mappings  

üëâ See [CATEGORIES.md](CATEGORIES.md) for a detailed breakdown of each, including origins and reliability levels.

‚ö†Ô∏è Not all coils or playback systems can naturally reproduce every frequency.  
Amplitude-modulated audio is sometimes required, and the provided scripts support this.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This repository is provided **for research, experimentation, and educational purposes only**.

- The authors and contributors **assume no liability** for the use or misuse of these scripts or the audio files they generate.  
- While certain frequencies are supported by peer-reviewed research, this does **not imply that every frequency is safe, nor that all included ranges are beneficial**.  
- Anyone experimenting with PEMF audio output does so **entirely at their own risk**.  

If you choose to explore this emerging technology, do so responsibly and with proper safety precautions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pemf-audio-generator.git
cd pemf-audio-generator
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Generate Theta frequencies (built-in)
```bash
pemfgen --category theta -o tracks
```

### 4. Generate all categories (requires CSV library)
```bash
pemfgen --category all -o tracks --csv library.csv
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for detailed instructions on metadata, amplitude modulation, and advanced options.

## üó∫ Roadmap

This project follows a **documentation-first, code-second** approach.  
The current focus is on implementing a baseline **Theta frequency generator**, with expansion into other categories via CSV libraries.

## üí¨ Getting Feedback

This project is still in its early stages, with a strong focus on **documentation and planning before code**.  
We welcome feedback on:

- Clarity of documentation (README, HISTORY, USAGE, etc.)  
- Accuracy of frequency categories and descriptions  
- Suggestions for additional references or safety notes  
- Ideas for features or improvements in the generator scripts  

üëâ You can give feedback by:
- Opening an **Issue** (questions, suggestions, or clarifications)  
- Starting a **Discussion** (general thoughts, experience with PEMF, or related projects)  
- Commenting on the **Roadmap Issue** to help shape priorities  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is for **research and educational purposes only**. Feedback on documentation, usability, and transparency is especially welcome at this stage.

## üõ† Project Goals
- Provide **transparent, reproducible scripts** for generating PEMF audio tracks.  
- Support **metadata-tagged files** for easy playback organization.  
- Encourage **research-based use**, not commercial or medical claims.  
- Keep contributions open, auditable, and provenance-driven.
