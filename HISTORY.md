# History of PEMF & Coils

## 🗓 Timeline Overview

| Year/Period | Scientific/Clinical Milestones | Alternative/Esoteric Milestones |
|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **1950s**   | Early PEMF research on bone growth & tissue repair begins | — |
| **1970s**   | Expanded medical studies on pain & healing | Hans Cousto develops *Cosmic Octave* (planetary frequencies) |
| **1979**    | FDA approves PEMF for non-union bone fractures | — |
| **1980s–90s** | Clinical trials broaden: arthritis, wound healing, neurology | Solfeggio frequencies popularized as “healing tones” |
| **1990s**   | Improved medical PEMF devices with controlled pulse parameters | Chakra frequencies mapped to musical notes |
| **2000s**   | — | Rodin coil gains popularity; DIY PEMF with audio amplifiers |
| **2010s**   | Ongoing studies into depression, recovery, and chronic pain | Widespread online frequency lists; PEMF blends with New Age practices |

## 📜 Scientific Origins
- **1950s–1970s:** PEMF first entered mainstream science as researchers studied how low-frequency electromagnetic fields could influence biological processes.  
- **1979:** The U.S. FDA approved PEMF for **non-union bone fractures**.  
- **1980s–1990s:** Research broadened to pain management, arthritis, wound healing, and neurology.  
- These devices used **controlled, reproducible pulse parameters** under clinical oversight.

---

## 🌌 Alternative & Esoteric Adoption
- **Solfeggio frequencies:** Derived from numerology and Gregorian chant reinterpretations.  
- **Chakra frequencies:** Linked to yogic traditions, mapped to Western notes.  
- **Planetary “Cosmic Octave”:** Hans Cousto mathematically scaled orbital periods into Hz ranges.  
- **Schumann resonances:** Real geophysical phenomena (~7.83 Hz fundamental) reframed as “earth grounding.”  

These systems were symbolic rather than clinical, but they drew significant public interest.

## 🌀 The Rodin Coil & Public Accessibility
- Early 2000s: The **Rodin coil** design spread in DIY and alternative energy circles.  
- Its geometry allowed audio amplifiers to drive it as a PEMF device.  
- This made PEMF exploration **widely accessible** but also **less safe**, due to absent hazard controls and lack of standardization.

## 🔬 Two Communities, Shared Curiosity
By the 2010s, PEMF research and practice had two parallel but overlapping streams:

1. **Scientific/Clinical** — measurable outcomes, regulated devices, peer-reviewed evidence.  
2. **Alternative/Esoteric** — symbolic mappings, spiritual practice, and hobbyist experimentation.  

Both share a common curiosity: how frequencies and fields might influence human well-being.

---

## 🌐 Open-Source Need
- Vendors’ frequency lists were often **opaque and uncited**.  
- Enthusiasts began calling for **open, auditable frequency libraries**.  
- Open-source PEMF projects aim to distinguish **peer-reviewed ranges** from **esoteric frameworks**.

## 🎯 This Project’s Role
This repository continues that tradition by providing:

1. **Reliable scripts** for generating PEMF-ready audio.  
2. A **CSV-driven frequency library** that makes categories transparent and editable.  
3. A **safety-first design**, embedding only **Theta frequencies** in code by default.  
4. A bridge between communities — enabling exploration with clarity and accountability.
