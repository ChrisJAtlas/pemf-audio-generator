# Vision & Roadmap

## Vision
The **PEMF Audio Generator** aims to provide a reliable, research-backed application for generating pulsed electromagnetic frequencies and related audio signals. While it would be possible to release a minimal version quickly, the projectâ€™s long-term value depends on careful research, rigorous testing, and well-documented methodologies. The goal is to ensure the tool is not only functional, but also scientifically credible and practically useful.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research & Documentation  
**Objective:** Build a reliable foundation of knowledge.  
- Collect and categorize all relevant frequencies.  
- Trace the origins of each frequency with multiple layers of confirmation and evidence of continued usage.  
- Compile notes to create high-quality metadata and documentation for each frequency.  

---

### Phase 2: Testing Framework  
**Objective:** Ensure generated audio is accurate and effective.  
- **Software validation**:  
  - Research audio analysis tools to confirm generated audio matches expected parameters.  
  - Compare generated material against established references.  
- **Hardware validation**:  
  - Investigate Linux-compatible tools and hardware for measuring PEMF and frequency output.  
  - Establish protocols for consistent and repeatable testing.  

---

### Phase 3: Benchmarking & Comparative Study  
**Objective:** Understand existing practices and position the project effectively.  
- Study literature on:  
  1. Theoretical applications of PEMF and frequency audio.  
  2. Practical/advised applications in real-world contexts.  
  3. Current industry practices (professional/non-consumer).  
  4. Consumer software and DIY community approaches.  
- Identify proven techniques that can be incorporated into the project.  

---

### Phase 4: Validation & Refinement  
**Objective:** Integrate research into development.  
- Incorporate validated techniques into the audio generation pipeline.  
- Establish robust testing methodologies informed by prior research.  
- Refine metadata and documentation for public release.  

---

### Phase 5: Release & Ongoing Development  
**Objective:** Deliver a credible, usable application.  
- Release an initial version with core frequency sets and validated output.  
- Continue iterative development, adding new categories of frequencies and improving test frameworks.  
- Maintain transparency through public documentation, changelogs, and research references.
