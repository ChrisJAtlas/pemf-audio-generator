# Categories of Frequencies

PEMF exploration has led to many different **frequency categories**, drawn from both **scientific research** and **esoteric traditions**.  
This document summarizes the main sets, their origins, and a high-level assessment of reliability.

## 🧠 Brainwave Bands
- **Range:**  
  - Delta (0.5–4 Hz)  
  - Theta (4–8 Hz)  
  - Alpha (8–12 Hz)  
  - Beta (13–30 Hz)  
  - Gamma (30+ Hz)  
- **Origin:** Discovered in the 1920s–1930s via EEG by Hans Berger.  
- **Use:** Well established in neuroscience; linked to sleep, relaxation, focus, and cognition.  
- **PEMF Context:** Attempted entrainment of brainwave activity by exposing the body to oscillations near these ranges.  
- **Reliability:** 🔬 **Strong Evidence (scientific foundation, measurable in EEG).**

## 🌍 Schumann Resonances
- **Range:** Fundamental ~7.83 Hz, harmonics at ~14, 20, 27, 33, 39, 45 Hz.  
- **Origin:** Predicted by Winfried Schumann (1952) as electromagnetic resonances in the Earth-ionosphere cavity.  
- **Use:** Measured globally with ELF antennas. Sometimes linked to biological rhythms due to overlap with brainwave ranges.  
- **PEMF Context:** Used symbolically for "earth grounding" or as a stabilizing frequency.  
- **Reliability:** 🟠 **Mixed Evidence (real geophysical phenomena, biological effects speculative).**

## 🎼 Solfeggio Frequencies
- **Range:** 174 Hz, 285 Hz, 396 Hz, 417 Hz, 528 Hz, 639 Hz, 741 Hz, 852 Hz, 963 Hz.  
- **Origin:** Popularized in the 1970s–1990s by Joseph Puleo and Leonard Horowitz, inspired by numerology and reinterpretations of Gregorian chants.  
- **Use:** Attributed spiritual and healing qualities (e.g., 528 Hz = “DNA repair”).  
- **PEMF Context:** Adopted into alternative healing and meditation practices.  
- **Reliability:** ⚠️ **Speculative (no peer-reviewed biomedical support).**

---

## 🕉 Chakra Frequencies
- **Range:** Often mapped as 288 Hz (Root) → 864 Hz (Crown), with notes aligned to Western scales.  
- **Origin:** Traditional Indian yogic system of energy centers, later overlaid with Western music theory.  
- **Use:** Frequencies are symbolic assignments, not part of classical chakra teachings.  
- **PEMF Context:** Applied in meditation/energy practices to align chakras.  
- **Reliability:** ⚠️ **Speculative (cultural overlay, not measured phenomena).**

---

## 🌌 Planetary / “Cosmic Octave”
- **Range:** e.g., 136.1 Hz (Earth year), 210.42 Hz (Moon synodic cycle), 183.58 Hz (Jupiter), etc.  
- **Origin:** Proposed by Hans Cousto in *The Cosmic Octave* (1978). Orbital periods are mathematically transposed into the audible range via octave scaling.  
- **Use:** Viewed as harmonic connections between cosmos and human systems.  
- **PEMF Context:** Used symbolically to “tune” to planetary cycles.  
- **Reliability:** ⚠️ **Speculative (mathematical mappings, not physiological).**

## 🏥 Therapeutic / Clinical Frequencies
- **Range:** Commonly cited values include:  
  - ~3 Hz (delta) — deep sleep, depression relief  
  - ~10 Hz (alpha) — relaxation, pain reduction  
  - ~15–30 Hz — bone regeneration, post-surgical healing  
  - ~40 Hz (gamma) — attention, cognitive focus  
- **Origin:** Derived from decades of clinical PEMF device research and FDA-approved protocols.  
- **Use:** Validated in bone healing and investigated in pain, depression, and recovery.  
- **PEMF Context:** Most evidence-based category, though effects are device- and protocol-specific.  
- **Reliability:** 🔬 **Strong Evidence (clinically studied, regulated use).**

## ⚠️ Note
This classification is **not prescriptive**. It exists to help readers distinguish between:  
- **Measured, peer-reviewed categories** (e.g., clinical PEMF, EEG brainwaves).  
- **Symbolic or cultural categories** (e.g., Solfeggio, Chakras, Cosmic Octave).  

This project supports both, but always **emphasizes transparency and provenance** so that users know which tradition a frequency belongs to.
