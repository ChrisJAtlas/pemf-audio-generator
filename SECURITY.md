# Security & Safety Policy

The **PEMF Audio Generator** project is open-source and intended for **research and educational purposes only**.  
While this is not a traditional software security–sensitive project (e.g., no user authentication or data storage), we still want to encourage **responsible reporting** of potential issues.

## 🔐 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover:
- A **code security vulnerability** (e.g., dependency exploit, unsafe file handling),  
- A **safety-related concern** (e.g., misleading documentation, inaccurate frequency claims that could cause misuse),  

please report it privately by opening a **security advisory** on GitHub or emailing the maintainers directly.

**Do not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly until they have been reviewed and addressed.

## ✅ Supported Versions

At this stage, the project is in early development.  
- The **`main` branch** is the only supported version.  
- All issues and vulnerabilities should be reported against `main`.

## 🧭 Responsible Use
